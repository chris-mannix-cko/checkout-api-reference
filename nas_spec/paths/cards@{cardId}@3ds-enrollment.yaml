  summary: Enroll a card into 3DS
  description: <b>3D secure</b> provides an additional layer of security to your cardholders for online payments and therefore reduces fraud and chargeback requests.<br><br>In order to <b>enable 3DS</b> on your issued cards, you will need to provide specific authentication data for the cards. We have to request the cardholder for this information through a challenge screen when making a payment online. To comply with the new <b>PSD2 regulation</b>, we support two-factor authentication. We propose a combination of <b>one-time password sent via SMS</b> + a choice of either <b>password</b> or <b>question & answer</b>.<br><br>Please provide the information related to <b>the combination during your companyâ€™s onboarding</b>. Only one choice is allowed. If the information sent is invalid for the option, then you will get an error message.
